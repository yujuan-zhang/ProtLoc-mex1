The core code of this project has been uploaded to the PyPI repository. To obtain it, please execute the following command:
pip install protloc_mex1

This project offers a comprehensive pipeline for the rapid development of subcellular localization prediction and model interpretation. It encompasses 42 amino acid feature characterization algorithms and Gene Ontology (GO) feature extraction based on the Doc2Vec approach. Additionally, two random forest models for protein localization prediction are provided.

All supplementary materials associated with the article can be found in the Supplementary_material folder. Furthermore, the code and detailed explanations related to the two experimental research cases mentioned in the article, Case 1 and Case 2, are available in their respective directories.

The subcellular localization classification models trained for Case 1 and Case 2 are stored separately in <Case1/Classification and feature filtering module/csae1_localization_model.pkl> and <Case2/Classification and feature filtering module/csae1_localization_model.pkl>. These models accept protein feature inputs identical to those in the demo file and generate corresponding predictions.

As the manuscript is currently under review, the complete core code and pre-trained models of ProtLoc-Mex1 have not been released. If you require access to the core code, please contact the author via email at 1024226968@qq.com.
