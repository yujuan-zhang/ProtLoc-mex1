# ProtLoc-mexl
The core code of this project has been uploaded to the PyPI library. If needed, please obtain it directly by using：
pip install protloc_mex1
This project provides a pipeline for fast construction of subcellular localization prediction and model interpretation, with 42 amino acid feature characterization algorithms and GO feature extraction based on Doc2Vec. In addition, two random forest models for protein localization prediction are also provided.
All supplementary materials for the article are located in the Supplementary_material file. Additionally, the code and step-by-step explanations related to the two experimental research cases mentioned in the article, case1 and case2, can be found in their respective files.
The subcellular localization classification models trained for case 1 and case 2 have been saved respectively in <Case1/Classification and feature filtering module/csae1_localization_model.pkl> and <Case2/Classification and feature filtering module/csae1_localization_model.pkl>. These models support input of protein features same to the demo file and provide corresponding predictions.
As the manuscript is still under review, we have not fully released the core code and pre-trained models of ProtLoc-Mex1. If you need the core code, please contact the author at 1024226968@qq.com by email.
